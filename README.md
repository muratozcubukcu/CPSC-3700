The mission of our website was to create an electronics E-commerce site utilizing a multitude of tools along with
website development languages like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Our team created and iterated upon a phone selling website 
that allows consumers to navigate across the home page to specific phone pages, and see the specifications of an individual phone, 
put it into a cart and buy it, as well as submit a review of their experience on the site, and to be able to see past consumer reviews.
During the development of this site, our team used a task log system where we would give each member tasks to complete in 2 week sprint
intervals. This would allow us to practice an agile methodology of working as a team putting forth small and meaningful changes to the site,
and getting ample feedback to improve it in our next sprint.
